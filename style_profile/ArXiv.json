    "name": "ArXiv",
    "description": "The ArXiv style is a scholarly writing style commonly used in academic research papers and articles, particularly in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, and related disciplines. This style is characterized by its clear, concise, and technical language, which prioritizes the accurate communication of complex ideas and concepts. The ArXiv style often employs mathematical notations, equations, and diagrams to support the text and facilitate understanding. Additionally, this style adheres to a structured format, including sections such as abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion, to present a well-organized and coherent argument. Citations and references in the ArXiv style follow standard academic conventions, ensuring proper attribution and credibility.",
    "examples": [
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solving the traveling salesman problem using a hybrid genetic algorithm and simulated annealing technique.",
        "The primary objective of our research is to develop an efficient numerical method for solving partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics.",
        "We derive a closed-form expression for the probability distribution function of the eigenvalues of a random matrix, extending the results of previous studies [1, 2].",
        "We introduce a new algorithm for the efficient computation of the discrete Fourier transform, which reduces the computational complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N)."
