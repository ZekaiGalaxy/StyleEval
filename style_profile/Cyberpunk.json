    "description": "Cyberpunk is a futuristic, edgy, and technologically-driven text style that often conveys a dystopian atmosphere. It is characterized by its bold, vivid colors, typically neon or metallic hues, and the frequent use of glitch effects, holographic patterns, and pixelated or distorted fonts. This style is heavily influenced by the cyberpunk genre in literature, movies, and video games, which often explores themes of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the fusion of man and machine. The cyberpunk text style creates a sense of immersion in a high-tech, yet gritty and rebellious world where advanced technology coexists with societal decay and moral ambiguity.",
